<h1>Cranelift</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a> project</p>
<p>Cranelift is a <em>fast</em>, <em>secure</em>, <em>relatively simple</em> and <em>innovative</em> compiler
backend. It takes an <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md">intermediate representation</a> of a program generated
by some frontend and compiles it to executable machine code. Cranelift is meant
to be used as a library within an &quot;embedder&quot;. It is in successful use by the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> WebAssembly virtual machine, for just-in-time (JIT) and
ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, and also as an <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">experimental backend</a>
for the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> compiler. Its most common use is as a WebAssembly compiler, but
it is fully general and usable for most code-generation needs. Cranelift itself
is written in Rust.</p>
<p>Cranelift currently supports x86-64, aarch64 (ARM64), s390x (IBM Z), and
riscv64 platforms. It is retargetable and contributions of further ISA support
are welcome.</p>
<p>Cranelift is actively maintained and used in production to run sandboxed
untrusted code with close-to-native performance. We continue to develop it to
add feature support, improve performance, and further verify its correctness.
We follow <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>'s <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html">release policy</a> and <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/security">security policy</a>.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast</strong>: Cranelift is developed with the speed of the compiler itself in
mind. We aim for Cranelift to be usable as a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. It
has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13127">measured</a> to perform the
code-generation process about an order of magnitude faster than an equivalent
LLVM-based system.</p>
<p>Cranelift aims to generate fast-enough code, as well. While it does not have
the aggressive optimization stance (or complexity) of larger compilers such
as <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> or <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, its output is often not too far off: the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13127">same
paper</a> showed Cranelift generating code
that ran ~2% slower than V8 (TurboFan) and ~14% slower than an LLVM-based
system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure</strong>: Cranelift has a strong focus on correctness and verification. In
addition to developing the compiler itself in a memory-safe language (Rust),
we continually work to test and verify the compiler in new ways with
<a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/1-year-update#improving-testing-with-fuzzing">fuzzing</a>, <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2021/03/15/cranelift-isel-3/">symbolic translation validation</a> of some stages, correctness
proofs for critical pieces where appropriate, and more recently, static
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~avh/veri-isle-preprint.pdf">formal verification</a> as well.  We have designed the compiler with
abstractions to prevent bugs and enforce invariants wherever possible. We
consciously navigate complexity tradeoffs and choose to avoid some riskier
and more error-prone optimization techniques. For example, unlike most
optimizing compilers, our IR does not have undefined behavior, by design.
Finally, we keep up to date with mitigation techniques, both for side-channel
attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre</a>, and for general defense-in-depth with <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/cfi-improvements-with-pauth-and-bti.md">hardware CFI
features</a> and other hardening.</p>
<p>Cranelift is also, like browser JIT engines' compilers but unlike LLVM or
gcc, specifically hardened against malicious compiler input: it is written to
guard against pathological runtimes, for example by avoiding
input-length-bounded recursion, and quadratic or higher algorithmic
complexity wherever possible. It is not a linear-time single-pass compiler,
but it is still suitable for compiling untrusted code (for example, Wasm
modules). We fuzz while monitoring for out-of-memory and timeout conditions
in compilation to verify this.</p>
<p>Cranelift follows the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/security">Bytecode Alliance security policy</a>.  We have had two sandbox-escape-capable miscompilation CVEs
since Cranelift development began in 2016. We welcome responsible
disclosure of vulnerabilities and we follow best practices in
disseminating notices and patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relatively simple</strong>: Cranelift is an optimizing compiler, but it aims to
take a fresh look at which optimizations are necessary. We have explicitly
avoided features -- such as advanced alias analysis or use of undefined
behavior -- that have historically led to subtle miscompilations in other
compilers. Cranelift consists of about 200 thousand lines of code; in
contrast, e.g. LLVM consists of over 20 million lines of code, a hundred
times larger. This difference also allows Cranelift to be relatively
approachable to developers, researchers, auditors and others who wish to
understand how it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovative</strong>: In order to compete as a viable alternative to larger
compilers, and in order to maximize correctness and security in particular,
Cranelift is open to innovative approaches, and aims to be an actively
welcoming home to research collaborations. We are (to our knowledge) the
first production compiler to use <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/27">e-graphs</a> to build a unified optimization
framework. We have developed new fuzzing techniques, such as a
<a href="https://www.jacarte.me/assets/pdf/wasm_mutate.pdf">semantics-preserving fuzzing mutator</a> and a <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2021/03/15/cranelift-isel-3/">symbolic translation
validator</a> for our register allocator. We
developed a <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/isle/docs/language-reference.md">custom pattern-matching DSL</a> for optimization rewrite rules and
instruction lowering rules in order to ensure correctness and allow
high-level integration with verification tools. We strongly leverage fuzzing
with custom oracles, such as differential comparison of execution results or
validation of invariants (in practice more similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Property_testing">property-based
testing</a>) in order to efficiently find bugs and develop with high confidence.
We actively collaborate with several academic groups to <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~avh/veri-isle-preprint.pdf">formally
verify</a> parts of the compiler.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Cranelift has <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/docs/">general documentation</a> describing aspects of its design,
such as its <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md">intermediate representation</a>, CLIF. Many of the <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime
documents</a> are also applicable: Cranelift is developed in-tree
in Wasmtime and generally follows its development, testing and release
processes, for example.</p>
<p>For users of Cranelift, the API documentation for the main crate
<a href="https://docs.rs/cranelift-codegen"><code>cranelift-codegen</code></a> and its auxiliary
helpers for IR producers and Wasm-centric embedders,
<a href="https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend"><code>cranelift-frontend</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/cranelift-wasm"><code>cranelift-wasm</code></a> respectively, may be useful
to reference. Developers of Cranelift backends will find the above API
references useful, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/isle/docs/language-reference.md">ISLE DSL reference</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, please do feel free to stop by our [Zulip chat instance] and ask
questions -- we are happy to help!</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>We welcome anyone who wishes to help develop Cranelift to join our
community and talk with us! The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/contributing.html">contributing</a> documentation page from
Wasmtime offers many tips that apply equally to Cranelift, as a
project hosted in the same repository with a largely overlapping
community. In particular, under the
<a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing.html#mentoring">mentoring</a>
heading on that documentation page, you can find links to &quot;easy first
issues&quot;. Finally, we hold a <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/tree/main/cranelift">weekly
meeting</a>
in which we discuss current development topics and ideas and usually
make a round of status updates. Joining this meeting may be a good way
to learn more about what we're working on (you don't have to speak!)
and anyone who wishes may join.</p>
